; A tune is a series of notes and rests. Durations (can be dotted) are:
;   e for eighth note
;   q for quarter note
;   h for half note
;   n for note
; Notes are a duration followed by a note of A-G with possible # or b.
; The octave is assumed to match the previous note. Use @n to change it.
; For example, tune1 starts:
;   q       a quarter note rest
;   G,A,B   three quarter notes, assumed to be in octave 5
;   hC@6    half note of C in octave 6
;   h.C     half note dotted (3 beats) of C, still in octave 6
;   qC      quarter note of C
;   G@5     quarter note of G. The timing is copied from the previous note:
;   etc.                 @5 is needed to play it lower than the preceding C
